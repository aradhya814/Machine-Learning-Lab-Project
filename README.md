# Machine-Learning-Lab-Project
This project aims to compare the performance of three distinct machine learning models on an
image dataset. Specifically, the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of image recognition, has been utilized for this analysis.
